### 2019-09-13 update

- Refactored mongoose to a proper common service.
- Added a Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration.

If you are familiar to docker and you have docker installed on your machine and just want to run the project without issues please do:

 - docker-compose build
 - docker-compose up
 - It will run the mongodb at port 27017 (for testing purposes only).
